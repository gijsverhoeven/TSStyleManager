Welcome to the TSStyleManager application's help pages. The TSStyleManager is a tool to manage label styles in your iOS projects. It allows you to define fonts, colors and shadows and group those items into a style. You can then export a bunch of code which simplifies the creation of UILabel objects with the styles you defined. See the included helpfiles to learn more about the application.
