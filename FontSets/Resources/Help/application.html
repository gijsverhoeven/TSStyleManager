Every tab allows you to add or remove items in a list. Use the '+' and '-' buttons in the bottom left corner of the window to add a new item or remove the currently selected item.

<h3>Sorting items</h3>
Items can be sorted alphabetically by any column. Click a column header to sort the list of items by that column, click it again to invert the order.
