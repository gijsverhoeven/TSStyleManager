<h2>TSStyleManager Help - The fonts tab</h2>
<hr/>
This section explains the Fonts-tab in the TSStyleManager.
<br><br>
In this tab you organise the different fonts. Add a font by clicking the '+' button in the bottom left corner and remove the selected font by clicking the '-' button. 
<br><br>
<h3>Including fonts</h3>
It is possible to select any font currently installed on your system. Keep in mind that if you want to use the selected font in your project, you have to add the font file to your project as a resource and add it to the "Fonts provided by application" list in your info.plist file.
<br><br>
<h3>Properties</h3>
A style has 4 properties:
<ul>
<li>- Postscript Name<br><i>The postscript name of the selected font. Select a font by double-clicking this cell. The font-window will show up and it will allow you to pick a font from the list.</i></li>
<li>- Size<br><i>The font-size being used in this font.</i></li>
<li>- Generated name<br><i>This is the name used for the UIFont category generated when exporting code. It cannot be edited.</i></li>
<li>- Comments<br><i>The user-defined comments for the font. This will be used in the generated code and serves as a reminder of the purpose of the font. For example: where is this font used?</i></li>
</ul>
